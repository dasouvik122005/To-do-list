# To-do-list
Full stack development 


A simple, responsive, and accessible to-do list application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app focuses on a clean user interface and uses the browser's `localStorage` to persistently store your tasks.

This project was built from scratch to demonstrate core front-end web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and modern CSS styling.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add & Manage Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them individually.
* **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so they remain even after you close the tab or refresh the page.

* **Bulk Actions:**
    * **Clear Completed:** A button to remove all tasks that have been marked as done.

* **Timestamps:** Each task automatically records and displays the date and time it was created.

* **Secure:** User input is sanitized by escaping HTML characters to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
